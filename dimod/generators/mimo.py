            provided, generated from other arguments.

        F: A complex or real valued channel in the form of a numpy array. If not
           provided, generated from other arguments. Note that for correct interpretation
           of SNRb, the channel power should be normalized to num_transmitters.

        modulation: Specifies the constellation (symbol set) in use by
            each user. Symbols are assumed to be transmitted with equal probability.
            Options are:
               * 'BPSK'
                   Binary Phase Shift Keying. Transmitted symbols are +1, -1;
                   no encoding is required.
                   A real valued channel is assumed.

               * 'QPSK'
                   Quadrature Phase Shift Keying.
                   Transmitted symbols are +1, -1, +1j, -1j;
                   spins are encoded as a real vector concatenated with an imaginary vector.

               * '16QAM'
                   Each user is assumed to select independently from 16 symbols.
                   The transmitted symbol is a complex value that can be encoded by two spins
                   in the imaginary part, and two spins in the real part. v = 2 s_1 + s_2.
                   Highest precision real and imaginary spin vectors, are concatenated to
                   lower precision spin vectors.

               * '64QAM'
                   A QPSK symbol set is generated, symbols are further amplitude modulated
                   by an independently and uniformly distributed random amount from [1, 3].

        num_transmitters: Number of users. Since each user transmits 1 symbol per frame, also the
             number of transmitted symbols, must be consistent with F argument.

        num_receivers: Num_Receivers of channel, :code:`len(y)`. Must be consistent with y argument.

        SNRb: Signal to noise ratio per bit on linear scale. When y is not provided, this is used
            to generate the noisy signal. In the case float('Inf') no noise is
            added. SNRb = Eb/N0, where Eb is the energy per bit, and N0 is the one-sided
            power-spectral density. A one-sided . N0 is typically kB T at the receiver.
            To convert units of dB to SNRb use SNRb=10**(SNRb[decibells]/10).

        transmitted_symbols:
            The set of symbols transmitted, this argument is used in combination with F
            to generate the signal y.
            For BPSK and QPSK modulations the statistics
            of the ensemble are unimpacted by the choice (all choices are equivalent
            subject to spin-reversal transform). If the argument is None, symbols are
            chosen as 1 or 1 + 1j for all users, respectively for BPSK and QPSK.
            For QAM modulations, amplitude randomness impacts the likelihood in a
            non-trivial way. If the argument is None in these cases, symbols are
            chosen i.i.d. from the appropriate constellation. Note that, for correct
            analysis of some solvers in BPSK and QPSK cases it is necessary to apply
            a spin-reversal transform.

        F_distribution:
           When F is None, this argument describes the zero-mean variance 1
           distribution used to sample each element in F. Permitted values are in
           tuple form: (str, str). The first string is either
           'normal' or 'binary'. The second string is either 'real' or 'complex'.
           For large num_receivers and number of users the statistical properties of
           the likelihood are weakly dependent on the first argument. Choosing
           'binary' allows for integer valued Hamiltonians, 'normal' is a more
           standard model. The channel can be real or complex. In many cases this
           also represents a superficial distinction up to rescaling. For real
           valued symbols (BPSK) the default is ('normal', 'real'), otherwise it
           is ('normal', 'complex')

        use_offset:
           When True, a constant is added to the Ising model energy so that
           the energy evaluated for the transmitted symbols is zero. At sufficiently
           high num_receivers/user ratio, and signal to noise ratio, this will
           be the ground state energy with high probability.

        attenuation_matrix:
           Root power associated to variable to chip communication; use
           for sparse and structured codes.

    Returns:
        The binary quadratic model defining the log-likelihood function
